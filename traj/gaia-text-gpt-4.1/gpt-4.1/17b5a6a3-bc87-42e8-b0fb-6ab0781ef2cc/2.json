                "text": "You are an expert assistant who can solve any task using code blobs. You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`. The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:\n{'question': 'Quel est l'animal sur l'image?', 'image': 'path/to/image.jpg'}\"\n\nThought: I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\nCode:\n```py\ntranslated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The translated question is {translated_question}.\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought: I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\nCode:\n```py\npages = search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nNo result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results. Let's try again with a broader query.\nCode:\n```py\npages = search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam\")\nprint(pages)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nFound 6 pages:\n[Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)\n\n[Ulam discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)\n\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I will read the first 2 pages to know more.\nCode:\n```py\nfor url in [\"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/\", \"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/\"]:\n    whole_page = visit_webpage(url)\n    print(whole_page)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*80 + \"\\n\")  # Print separator between pages\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nManhattan Project Locations:\nLos Alamos, NM\nStanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician. He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let's answer in one word.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\nfor city in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", search(f\"{city} population\")\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `wiki` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age_wiki = wiki(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".pdb\",\".csv\",\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- download_file: \nDownload a file at a given URL (not a path in the computer). The file should be of this format: [\".pdf\",\".txt\",\".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".png/.jpg\", \".docx\"]\nAfter using this tool, for further inspection of this page you should return the download path to your manager via final_answer, and they will be able to inspect it.\nRETURN FORMAT as {\"file_path\":path, \"description\":\"description of the file\"}.\nDO NOT use this tool for .htm: for these types of files use visit_webpage with the file url instead.\n    Takes inputs: {'url': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The relative or absolute url of the file to be downloaded.'}, 'file_format': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Optional: The format of the file to be downloaded.', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- web_search: Performs a duckduckgo web search based on your query (think a Google search) then returns the top search results.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The search query to perform.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- go_back: Goes back to previous page.\n    Takes inputs: {}\n    Returns an output of type: null\n- search_item_ctrl_f: Searches for text on the current page via Ctrl + F and jumps to the nth occurrence.\n    Takes inputs: {'text': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The text to search for'}, 'nth_result': {'type': 'integer', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'Which occurrence to jump to (default: 1)'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- visit_webpage: Markdownify the webpage you visited to provide basic webpage information. Provide the accessibility tree for more precise web-related action.\n    Takes inputs: {'url': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The URL of the webpage to visit.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- perform_click: Click the button or link in the website.\n    Takes inputs: {'index': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'The index of the element in the accessibility tree.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- perform_input: Enter the text into the text box corresponding to the index.\n    Takes inputs: {'index': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'The index of the text box in the accessibility tree.'}, 'text': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The content you want to input into the text box.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['Bio', 'PIL', 'PyPDF2', 'bs4', 'chess', 'collections', 'csv', 'datetime', 'fractions', 'helium', 'io', 'itertools', 'json', 'math', 'numpy', 'openpyxl', 'os', 'pandas', 'pptx', 'pubchempy', 'pydub', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'scipy', 'sklearn', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sympy', 'time', 'torch', 'unicodedata', 'xml', 'yahoo_finance', 'zipfile']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000."

Facts given in the task\n- The species of fish in question became popular as a pet after being the main character in the movie \"Finding Nemo.\"\n- According to the USGS (United States Geological Survey), the locations where this fish was found as a nonnative species prior to 2020 are requested.\n- The answer must be formatted as the five-digit zip codes of the places the species was found, separated by commas if more than one place.\n\nReasoning:\n- No specific fish species is named in the task, only referenced by its association with \"Finding Nemo\" as the main character.\n- The relevant source for nonnative occurrences is USGS.\n\n### 1.2. Facts to look up\n- The species of fish that was the main character of \"Finding Nemo.\"  \n  *Source: Implicit knowledge/public information about the movie \"Finding Nemo.\"*\n- USGS records of nonnative occurrences of this species before 2020, including location details.  \n  *Source: USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database, official USGS website or database.*\n- The conversion or mapping of occurrence location to corresponding five-digit zip codes where the species was found.  \n  *Source: Location data reported by USGS, zip code lookup tools, postal service databases.*\n\nReasoning:\n- Need to confirm the specific species (likely the clownfish, but must verify with external reference).\n- Need to retrieve and confirm the exact locations in the US where the species was reported as nonnative before 2020 from USGS.\n- If locations are given as coordinates or place names, need to look up their corresponding zip codes.\n\n### 1.3. Facts to derive\n- The list of zip codes representing locations where the fish species was found as nonnative, according to USGS, prior to 2020.\n- If multiple places, derive the formatted string of zip codes, separated by commas.\n\nReasoning:\n- Raw USGS data may need to be interpreted: location → zip code, verify all occur before 2020, format as per instructions.\n\n---\n\n## Plan\n\n1. Identify and verify the species of fish that was the main character in \"Finding Nemo.\"\n2. Search the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database, or official USGS database, for records of this species found as a nonnative in the United States before 2020.\n3. Gather details of all such occurrences, specifically noting the location information (city/town/state or coordinates).\n4. For each location retrieved, look up the corresponding five-digit zip code.\n5. Compile the list of zip codes into a comma-separated string (if more than one).\n6. Verify that all derived zip codes are correct and correspond to the places the USGS found the species prior to 2020.\n7. Present the final formatted answer as required: only the five-digit zip codes, separated by commas.\n\n```"
