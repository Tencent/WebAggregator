Extremely detailed answer\\n\\nTo answer the question, we need to identify:\\n- Which year was Celeste eligible for The Game Awards? \\n- Which categories did it win, and were any repeated?\\n\\n**From the Accolades Table in the document:**\\n\\nUnder the year 2018 and \"The Game Awards 2018\", the following categories and results are listed:\\n- Game of the Year — Nominated\\n- Best Score/Music — Nominated\\n- Games for Impact — Won\\n- Best Independent Game — Won\\n\\nTherefore, Celeste won awards in these **TWO unique categories**:\\n1. **Games for Impact** – This category recognizes games with a significant social or emotional message or impact.\\n2. **Best Independent Game** – This category recognizes the best game developed outside the traditional publisher system (an \"indie\" game).\\n\\nSome entries refer to nominations, but only \"Games for Impact\" and \"Best Independent Game\" are marked \"Won,\" and both are distinct categories.\\n\\n**Summary table:**\\n\\n| Category              | Result   |\\n|-----------------------|----------|\\n| Games for Impact      | Won      |\\n| Best Independent Game | Won      |\\n\\nThus, the number of unique categories Celeste won at The Game Awards in 2018 is **2**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n3. Additional Context on the document and question asked\\n\\nThe document contains a detailed Wikipedia-style article on Celeste, chronicling its development, gameplay, critical reception, community impact, and awards. The \"Accolades\" section lists all major awards for Celeste, specifically breaking down by year, award show/ceremony, category, and result.\\n\\nRegarding The Game Awards 2018 (the show recognizing games released that year, and the most prominent award ceremony in the industry), the table unambiguously shows exactly which categories Celeste won—by noting \"Won\" versus \"Nominated.\" The question asks specifically for unique categories won at this specific award event, excluding nominations and including only wins.\\n\\nIn summary: Celeste won **two unique categories** at The Game Awards 2018—Games for Impact and Best Independent Game.\\nLast output from code snippet:\\nNone', observations_images=None, action_output=None)", "ActionStep(model_input_messages=None, tool_calls=[ToolCall(name='python_interpreter', arguments='# Search for Celeste chapter \\'Core\\' and \\'Farewell\\' dialogue transcript so we can determine the unique characters with dialogue in both.\\ncore_transcript_search = web_search(query=\"Celeste Core chapter dialogue transcript\")\\nprint(\"Core transcript search:\", core_transcript_search)', id='call_8')], start_time=1757574822.3251488, end_time=1757574829.04706, step_number=7, error=AgentExecutionError('Code execution failed at line \\'core_transcript_search = web_search(query=\"Celeste Core chapter dialogue transcript\")\\' due to: BadRequestError: Error code: 400 - {\\'code\\': 20012, \\'message\\': \\'Model does not exist.
